 if content of a tag is overflowing and u dont  want to overlow and show '...' at the end of the displayable text use text-overflow: ellipsis
 use the title attribute of the tag to display the whole text in a box on hovering ellipsis text.
i want to fetch the single product on routing to the single product page methods:
 a) use useEffect in the particular page and invoke the function created locally.
 b) if that function which fetches the product is used in multiple places then create it in the products context and it can be used anywhere.
